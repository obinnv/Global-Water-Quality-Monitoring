# Decentralized Global Water Quality Monitoring System

A blockchain-based platform for real-time water quality monitoring, analysis, and response coordination across global water systems.

## Overview

The Decentralized Global Water Quality Monitoring System enables automated, transparent monitoring of water quality through a network of IoT sensors. The platform processes data in real-time, issues alerts for quality concerns, and coordinates response efforts through smart contracts.

## Core Components

### Sensor Network Contract
- Manages IoT sensor registration and verification
- Tracks sensor calibration and maintenance
- Handles data collection protocols
- Ensures data integrity and authenticity
- Coordinates sensor network topology
- Manages sensor stake and reputation systems

### Data Analysis Contract
- Processes real-time water quality metrics
- Implements machine learning models for anomaly detection
- Maintains historical data analysis
- Generates quality trend reports
- Validates data against regulatory standards
- Provides predictive analytics for quality trends

### Alert System Contract
- Issues real-time contamination warnings
- Manages alert priority levels
- Coordinates notification distribution
- Tracks alert acknowledgments and responses
- Maintains communication protocols
- Handles alert verification and false positive management

### Remediation Coordination Contract
- Facilitates emergency response deployment
- Tracks remediation efforts and progress
- Manages resource allocation
- Coordinates stakeholder communications
- Documents intervention outcomes
- Handles cost tracking and settlement

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)
- IoT sensor integration capability
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) support
- Network connectivity for sensors
- Environmental monitoring permissions

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/water-quality-system.git

# Install dependencies
cd water-quality-system
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Deploy smart contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

### Configuration
1. Set environment variables in `.env`:
    - `SENSOR_NETWORK_KEY`: IoT network access
    - `ANALYSIS_API_KEY`: Data processing service
    - `ALERT_SYSTEM_KEY`: Emergency notification system
    - `REGULATORY_API_KEY`: Compliance verification

2. Configure system parameters in `config.js`:
    - Sensor specifications
    - Quality thresholds
    - Alert criteria
    - Response protocols

## Usage

### Sensor Management
```javascript
// Example of registering a new sensor
await sensorNetwork.registerSensor(
    sensorId,
    location,
    specifications,
    calibrationData
);
```

### Data Analysis
```javascript
// Example of submitting water quality data
await dataAnalysis.processReadings(
    sensorId,
    qualityMetrics,
    timestamp,
    metadata
);
```

### Alert Handling
```javascript
// Example of issuing a quality alert
await alertSystem.issueAlert(
    location,
    contaminationType,
    severityLevel,
    affectedArea
);
```

### Remediation Management
```javascript
// Example of initiating remediation
await remediationCoordination.initiateResponse(
    alertId,
    responseType,
    resources,
    timeline
);
```
